=========
CelestronRemoteReference is a bare minimum control program for the Celestron arm - it will send drive commands, but cannot read back position. It is maintained as a minimal functional reference program.

CelestronRemote is a working copy intended to be built out to support all arm commands. It is not fully functional as of the time of this commit.
